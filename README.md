# Team RMD
## Idea for the project:
Our main idea is to create a web application, along with a mobile app which we will try to run without internet to help during the time of disasters. The idea of a mobile app without working internet is for the people who are actually trapped in the disaster and can’t access internet. We are thinking along the lines of the mobile app using mobile network towers for the approximate location of the person trapped.

The features which we have planned of incorporating in our app that will help the client to make sure that they can successfully manage themselves during a disaster and also can help others out at the same time include:
### Donation Page:
A donation page where people can donate money, for this facility we will try to integrate a payment gateway into the application. Also for donation of goods we have thought of sharing nearby drop locations according to the donor’s current location.
### Casualty and Injury Stats:
The application will also display the most recently updated information of people who are dead and those who are quite critical along with the address of the hospital/relief camp they are sheltered in. This would help relatives easily identify the victim and reach out to them soon instead of making lots of phone calls in the helpline numbers.
### SOS Button:
SOS button is a feature of the mobile app where a contact pre-saved by the client will be alerted with the current location and other critical information of the client who is in danger with a press of a button.
### Help Manual for Common Disasters:
The application will provide a survival manual for various common situations where individuals may find themselves in during a disaster, and will provide tips on how to go about them.
### Emergency Contact Numbers:
The app will list all emergency contact numbers for the client to contact for a particular situation and even add its own.
### Warnings:
The applications developed will be able to notify the user about bad weather or warnings given out by the IMD and applications like AccuWeather, etc. 
### Nearby Location Situation:
The app will mark areas nearby the user that are safe and those that are dangerous to enter during a particular disaster.


The features mentioned above are in lines of either helping in managing the aftermath of the disaster or during the disaster or helping in predicting/giving warnings about a disaster which may happen.
